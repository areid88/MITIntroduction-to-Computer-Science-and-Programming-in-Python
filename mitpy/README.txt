This is my answers to a python problem set published by MIT for their "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" course. (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)

I will update this file as I work through the 6 problem sets, each set will have commented notes describing each assingment.
